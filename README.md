## Installation

It is best installed it through [packagist](http://packagist.org/packages/desarrolla2/rss-client) by including
`desarrolla2/rss-client` in your project composer.json require:

        "desarrolla2/rss-client":  "dev-master"
    }
```

You can also download it from [Github] (https://github.com/desarrolla2/RSSClient), but no autoloader is provided so you'll need to register it with your own PSR-0 compatible autoloader.
